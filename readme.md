#  Getting Started

## 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/obys-clone.git
cd obys-clone
```

## 2. Open in Browser
  - Open index.html in your browser
    or

  - Use Live Server (VS Code Extension) for a smoother development experience.

## 3. Key Interactions Explained
  ### 🖱️ Custom Cursor & Magnetic Effect
  - A custom circular cursor follows your mouse.

  - Elements like nav links and dots become magnetic with smooth transitions powered by Shery.js.

  ### 📹 Video Interaction
  - Hovering over the video section changes the cursor to a Play button.

  - On click: the video plays/pauses with a scaling animation and icon change.

  ### 🌀 Image Hover Distortion
  - Hovering on .image-div applies distortion effects using Shery.js, giving a gooey/glitchy visual feel.

  ### 🔃 Smooth Scroll + ScrollTrigger Sync
  - Locomotive Scroll handles inertia-based scrolling.
    
  -  GSAP ScrollTrigger is integrated with scrollerProxy for pinning elements and triggering animations at scroll positions.

  ### 📱 Responsiveness
  - The site is optimized for mobile-first view:

  - Media query for max-width: 600px

  - Loader positioning fixed on small screens

  - Hero text scaled down

  - Circles and interactive effects hidden or adjusted for mobile UX

  ### 🧩 To-Do
   - Add navigation animations

   - Add projects filter or category system

   - Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

   - Add dark/light mode toggle (optional)

   - Optimize performance on mobile
